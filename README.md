- `data/` - Raw and processed data files
- `models/` - Trained machine learning models
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- `src/` - Source code and utility functions
- `results/` - Output files, visualizations, and results

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies (see requirements.txt) -> currently empty
3. Download the dataset to the `data/` directory -> to be done on your device with the file in data/scripts/
4. Run the notebooks to reproduce the analysis -> currently no notebooks.
